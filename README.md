# project-automation
Automate the steps involved in initialising a new project
---
This project was created using simple shell scripting and requests module in python3. It uses the **[GitHub REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/)** for authentication of user and creation of new repository.

## WHAT IT DOES:
This project essentially simplifies the boring procedure associated with starting a new project. One small command will now create a project directory in a desired location for you, and make a GitHub repository for the same and initialize it with an empty README.md file and an initial commit. Can save a lot of your time!

## CONFIGURATION:
1. Depending on which shell you are using modify either **~/.bashrc** or **~/.zshrc** file. If you donâ€™t have any idea about this, just go for the **~/.bashrc** file.

2. Add the following line of code to **~/.bashrc**or **~/.zshrc** and save it
```bash
source ~/dev/projects/project-automation/source/.commands.sh
```
3. Edit source/config.py and add your GitHub username to the file and other modify other values as necessary. And you're set to go...

## HOW TO USE:
forge [ project-name ]

Missing *argument* will throw error.

**Example**
```bash
forge Mjolnir
```
## EXTRAS:
Ensure you have **__Python__** installed, preferrably **__Python3__**

If you are using **HTTPS** to add repos you might be asked for credentials as an initial commit is made on initialising the repo.

To avoid this simply go to **init.sh** and change the **HTTPS** link to **SSH** one.
