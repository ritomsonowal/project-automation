## HOW TO USE:
forge [ project-name ]

Missing *argument* will throw error.

forge Mjolnir
```
## EXTRAS:
If you are using **HTTPS** to add repos you might be asked for credentials as an initial commit is made on initialising the repo.

To avoid this simply go to **init.sh** and change the **HTTPS** link to **SSH** one.
